# Working on DELIOS — read this first, every session

## Where what we agreed is written

Read these before changing anything they cover. When a decision is made in
conversation, write it into the right one in the same commit as the code.

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` (this file) | How to work with the owner, and the rules that must never break |
| `docs/STANDARD-CHANGES.md` | What the original Document Management Standard must change to match what we built. Every new rule about controlling information goes here. |
| `docs/REVIEW-MODEL.md` | The review model: routes, steps, advice, verdicts, release |
| `docs/BEHAVIOUR-CHANGES.md` | What behaves differently since the screens moved onto the backend |
| `docs/gaps/*.md` | Known gaps per area |
| `PRODUCT.md` | Product context and users |

## How to work with the owner

- Short, plain replies. No jargon. PowerShell commands one per block.
- Never send screenshots or pictures.
- Never quote a bare document number as a reference.
- Ask before choosing any code (status, verdict, type…). A code never changes once used.
- Nothing is deleted except by the app owner.
- No model names in commits. Commit and push to the working branch.
- Do not run the tests unless asked; do compile (`dotnet build`, `npx tsc --noEmit`).
- Think about the whole flow, not a patch. When the owner reports something
  wrong, revisit the whole flow it belongs to (start → withdraw → send again →
  advise → decide → release → issue), not only the line reported.
- Never remove behaviour that exists without saying so and why.
- No code written inside the page (no inline scripts, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`).
  Display preferences (theme, sidebar width) live in cookies the server reads.

## Rules that must never break

### Reviews
- Every route step names who answers it: people, a function, or an outside
  party. Never empty. Screens always show the actual names, on every step,
  including steps not yet reached.
- The sender may change the people on each step for that review; that choice
  is what the review uses, and the record says so.
- Sending for review opens the new review's page.
- A review is only ever started from the Send for review form (route, people
  per step, copies). No "create and send" shortcut on the new-document or
  new-revision forms: create first, then send from the document's page.
- A revision is never in two reviews at once.
- Advisers pick advice from the published advice list; never less than their
  comments say.
- Comments are written with the answer, under the verdict or advice choice,
  and are obligatory only when that choice carries comments (comments,
  blocking comments, C2, C3, accepted with comments, rejected). There is no
  separate comment box.
- "Issued for" starts as the revision's purpose (IFR when none). Each step
  confirms it or changes it. The decider's grant is what the revision carries
  and is released at; Document Control does not choose it.
- Progress shows "you are here" on where things really stand: the open step
  while in review, "Not released" once decided.
- "Leave it to…" (who receives it) goes to whoever started the review.

### Revisions
- Until released, everything is editable in one "Edit rev X" step: PDF, native
  file, title and every field. Author or Document Control. The Details tab uses
  the same fields and, while a revision is prepared, points to Edit rev.
- A document's details change only with a revision in preparation (or before
  its first revision). Once out of preparation, a change takes a new revision;
  the backend refuses otherwise. Records keep their own details edit.
- In review: "Withdraw from review" with a reason, on the document page and the
  review page. The review stays in the register as **Withdrawn** with its
  reason and comments; everyone on the route is told. The revision can then be
  sent again.
- Revisions are never skipped, and an upload elsewhere never creates one.
- Starting a revision asks one text, "What changed, and why" (never two fields
  saying the same), plus a PDF and a native file, both optional at start.
- A withdrawn review is closed: no advice, verdict or comment can be given on
  it. Its progress ends at "Withdrawn"; a release comes from a later review.

### Legal hold
- Document Control or an administrator puts a document on hold, and lifts it,
  each time with a reason. While held: it cannot be retired and no revision
  voided (backend refuses with ON_LEGAL_HOLD). New revisions and reviews go on.
  The document page shows a banner with since when, who and why.

### Schedule & actions
- The schedule (SCH), disciplines per action (DPA) and requirements (RQL) are
  register documents, revised and released on the document page.
- Their Excel is uploaded on Schedule & actions only by Document Control or a
  function with the Plan permission.
- Released revision: "this file is rev X as released" is ticked by default;
  only when unticked is a reason obligatory. No released revision: a reason is
  obligatory. Always logged. Same on all three uploads.
- Actions get our own number (A00001…) and keep the planner's ID beside it.
- Progress on an action: a date still to come is shown as due, never as done.
- "Documents ready" counts only the actions in a window: a month either side
  of today, or the dates the user filtered on. Never the whole schedule.
